Our dress code policy contains:
   ‚Ä¢ "Business casual attire"
   ‚Ä¢ "Jeans permitted"
   ‚Ä¢ "No shorts or flip-flops"

But employees search using:
   ‚Ä¢ "clothing rules" (not "attire" or "policy")
   ‚Ä¢ "what to wear" (not "dress code")
   ‚Ä¢ "office fashion" (not "business casual")

SQL LIKE only matches EXACT words:
   ‚ùå "clothing" ‚â† "attire" (even though they mean the same!)
   ‚ùå "rules" ‚â† "policy" (even though they mean the same!)
   ‚ùå "wear" ‚â† "dress" (even though they're related!)

Result: 67% of queries FAIL even though the answer EXISTS!

üìà Success Rate: Only 33% (1 out of 3 queries worked)
   ‚Ä¢ Query 1 ‚úÖ: Used exact words from the policy
   ‚Ä¢ Query 2 ‚ùå: Used synonyms (clothing/attire)
   ‚Ä¢ Query 3 ‚ùå: Used related words (wear/dress)
