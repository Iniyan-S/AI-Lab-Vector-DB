# Employee Handbook

## Dress Code Policy

Our company maintains a business casual dress code Monday through Thursday. Employees may wear jeans and casual shirts on Fridays only. Athletic wear, shorts, and flip-flops are not permitted in the office at any time. Client-facing employees should maintain professional attire during client meetings, regardless of the day of the week.

## Time Off and Vacation

All full-time employees accrue 15 vacation days annually, beginning from their start date. Vacation requests must be submitted at least two weeks in advance through the HR portal. Holiday time off requires manager approval one month in advance. Sick leave is separate from vacation time and employees receive 10 sick days per year. Unused vacation days may be carried over to the next year, up to a maximum of 5 days.

## Work Hours and Breaks

Standard work hours are 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Employees are entitled to two 15-minute paid breaks daily. Lunch breaks are 30 to 60 minutes and are unpaid. Break rooms are available on each floor with complimentary coffee and snacks. Flexible work hours may be arranged with manager approval.

## Performance Reviews

Performance evaluations are conducted quarterly for all employees. Annual reviews determine salary adjustments and promotions. Employees must complete self-evaluations prior to review meetings. 360-degree feedback is collected from peers and direct reports. Performance improvement plans are implemented when necessary.
